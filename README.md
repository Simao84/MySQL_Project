### Project Overview
In this project, we are going to establish a database system agribusiness management. The database will store data about temperature, pesticides on yield and the GDP of various countries. These data will enables Farmers/agronomists and Agro- Consultant to understanding the optimal use of pesticides and how different temperature range impact crops can help on	maximizing crop yields, reduce the crop yield losses, cost management on pesticides use. In addition, this helps Policy Makres in setting safe pesticide usage limits and in creating guidelines to mitigate the effects of temperature extremes on crops.
### Project Workflow
This project will cover four main aspect of database system implementation:
Data Modeling
Data Integration
